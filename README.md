racket-flappy
=============

This is a Racket implementation of the crazy 
[flappy-bird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). It's minimal, ugly and
just for fun :). **For better gaming experience, you may refer here:
[flappy-bird-online](http://flappybird.io/?game) maintained by other
enthusiasts.**


To play, assume you've already installed [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/). 
Then execute run.sh. Also, you can load "source.rkt" and execute (start-bird) in
the REPL.
